# Support for any URLs via the Microsoft Graph Developer Proxy

Some applications are using an hybrid approach when it comes to consuming APIs. Some APIs are available on Microsoft Graph while some are not. To enable developers to fully test their scenarios with the Microsoft Graph Developer Proxy, the proxy should support acting as a reverse proxy for more than just one URL at a time, and include URLs that are outside of the Microsoft Graph. This can also be used by internal teams to test their APIs on internal endpoints.

| Version | Date | Comments | Author |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | --- |
| 1.1 | 2022-12-16 | change hosts to full URLs | @waldekmastykarz |
| 1.0 | 2022-12-09 | Initial specifications | @sebastienlevert |

## Configuration file

Reusing the `appSettings.json` configuration file should be possible for developers who want to support scenarios outside of Microsoft Graph. This file should have default values for all supported Microsoft Graph clouds and SharePoint URLs.

This configuration can also be extended by "any" URLs to support 1P endpoints, vanity URLs, custom services, etc.

```json
{
  "urlsToWatch": [
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.us/beta/*",
    "https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/*",
    "https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/beta/*",
    "https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn/v1.0/*",
    "https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn/beta/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint.*/*_api/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint.*/*_vti_bin/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint-df.*/*_api/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint-df.*/*_vti_bin/*",
    "https://customService.azurewebsites.net/*"
  ]
}
```

We want to watch full URLs instead of just hosts, so that we can intercept only API calls. This will let users have more control over the URLs they want to watch. Additionally, it will make it possible to use the Proxy when building solutions connected to Microsoft Graph using SPFx, which require that users are able to navigate to web pages in the browser, which are hosted on the same domain as the API calls.

## Remove the `--cloud` option on the Proxy

This new capability renders the `--cloud` option obsolete on the Proxy. We should remove the capability and its associated documentation.

## Mocking responses

Responses can be mocked and should be updated to include the absolute URL for the response to be returned. 

```json
{
  "responses": [
    {
      "url": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
      "responseBody": {
        "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
        "businessPhones": [
          "+1 412 555 0109"
        ],
        "displayName": "Megan Bowen",
        "givenName": "Megan",
        "jobTitle": "Auditor",
        "mail": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
        "mobilePhone": null,
        "officeLocation": "12/1110",
        "preferredLanguage": "en-US",
        "surname": "Bowen",
        "userPrincipalName": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com",
        "id": "48d31887-5fad-4d73-a9f5-3c356e68a038"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```
