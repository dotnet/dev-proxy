# Contributing to Dev Proxy

We're excited to accept contributions!

## You have an idea for a new feature

Awesome! Good ideas are invaluable for every product. Before you start hacking away, please check if there is no similar idea already listed in the [issue list](/dotnet/dev-proxy/issues). This ensures that your idea is unique and not being worked on. If you don't find a similar idea, create a new issue describing your idea. Once we agree on the feature scope and architecture, the feature will be ready for building. Don't hesitate to mention this in the issue if you'd like to build the feature yourself.

## You have a suggestion for improving an existing feature

Nothing is perfect. If you have an idea for how to improve an existing feature or Dev Proxy itself, let us know by submitting an issue in the [issue list](/dotnet/dev-proxy/issues). We value your input. Some things are done for a reason, but some are not. Let's discuss what you think and see how the project could be improved for everyone.

## You've found a bug

Bugs happen. When you find a bug, please have a look at the [issue list](/dotnet/dev-proxy/issues) to validate if a similar bug has already been logged. This helps avoid duplicate bug reports. If you don't find a similar bug report, let us know what isn't working and provide steps to reproduce it. If we can't reproduce your bug, we will ask you for clarification, which will only delay the resolution.

## Fixing typos

Typos are embarrassing! Most PRs that fix typos will be accepted immediately. To make it easier to review the PR, please narrow the focus instead of sending a huge PR of fixes.

## DO's & DON'Ts

- **DO** follow the same project and test structure as the existing project.
- **DO** keep discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up, it's often better to create a new issue than to side-track the conversation.
- **DO NOT** submit PRs for coding style changes. These changes can cause unnecessary conflicts and make the review process more complicated.
- **DO NOT** surprise us with big PRs. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- **DO NOT** commit code you didn't write. We encourage you to contribute your own work to maintain

## Our foundation

The Dev Proxy is built with .NET 9 and uses the [Unobtanium Web Proxy](https://github.com/svrooij/unobtanium-web-proxy).
